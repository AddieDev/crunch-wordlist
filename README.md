# Crunch Wordlist Files

Some wordlist I created using Crunch. 

## [6 Digit Pin List](https://github.com/LinuxPhreak/crunch-wordlist/blob/master/6-digit-pin-list.txt)
This list is good for brute force cracking 6 digit numeric pins.

## [4 Digit Pin List](https://github.com/LinuxPhreak/crunch-wordlist/blob/master/4-digit-pin-list.txt)
This list is good for brute force cracking 4 digit numeric pins.

## [dates](https://github.com/LinuxPhreak/crunch-wordlist/tree/master/dates)
Dates in several formats because many people use dates as their passwords or pins
